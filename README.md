# Hand-Hygiene-Monitoring-System-using-Gesture-Recognition 
A hand wash monitoring system to help maintain proper hand hygiene.Practicing hand hygiene is a simple yet effective way to prevent infections. Hospital staff tends to perform hand hygiene properly often only when they are aware that they are being observed. To track compliance, we aim to design a simple, cost‐effective solution easily reproducible on a mass scale which will in real time, monitor the entire process of hand washing.  
There are 8 steps recommended by WHO to maintain proper hygiene of hands.These 8 steps are described below:  

In this project, we present a hand wash monitoring and reminder system that monitors hand wash events and their quality, provides real time feedback , reminds the person of interest how he is required to wash hands. Aim is to develop a working product that can differentiate hand wash gestures from other gestures with an high accuracy .Product must be robust, scalable, and easy to install, and it over‐comes most of the problems of existing related systems.

In the same way 8 steps of hand hygiene were trained
